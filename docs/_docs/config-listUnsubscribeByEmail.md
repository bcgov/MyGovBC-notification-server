Some email clients provide a consistent UI to unsubscribe if an unsubscription email address is supplied. For example, newer iOS built-in email app will display following banner

![list unsubscription]({{site.baseurl}}/img/list-unsubscription.png)

To support this unsubscription method, *NotifyBC* implements a custom inbound SMTP server to transform received emails sent to address *un-{subscriptionId}-{unsubscriptionCode}@{inboundSmtpServerDomain}* to *NotifyBC* unsubscribing API calls. This unsubscription email address is generated by *NotifyBC* and set in header *List-Unsubscribe* of all notification emails.

To enable list-unsubscribe by email

* set up [inbound smtp server](../config-inboundSmtpServer/)
* verify config *notification.handleListUnsubscribeByEmail* is set to true or absent in */server/config.local.js*

To disable list-unsubscribe by email, set *notification.handleListUnsubscribeByEmail* to false in */server/config.local.js*

```
module.exports = {
  ...
  notification: {
    ...
    handleListUnsubscribeByEmail: false,
  }
}
```
